# 🧠 Part 1 – Theoretical Understanding

## **Q1. Differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch**

| Feature | TensorFlow | PyTorch |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Computation Style** | Static graph (TensorFlow 1.x), dynamic graph (TensorFlow 2.x) | Fully dynamic (“define-by-run”) |
| **Ease of Debugging** | Harder in TF 1.x; improved in TF 2.x | Easier debugging with Pythonic syntax |
| **Deployment** | Excellent for production (TensorFlow Serving, TFLite, TF.js) | Favored for research and flexibility |
| **When to Choose** | For scalable, production-ready systems | For quick experimentation and prototyping |

## **Q2. Two Use Cases for Jupyter Notebooks**

1. **Interactive Experimentation:**  
   Jupyter allows developers to test small blocks of code interactively and view immediate results — ideal for ML prototyping.

2. **Documentation & Sharing:**  
   Combines code, visualizations, and markdown notes in one document — useful for collaboration, tutorials, and reproducible research.

## **Q3. How spaCy Enhances NLP Tasks**

- spaCy offers **pre-trained NLP models** that perform tokenization, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition (NER).  
- It’s faster and more consistent than basic Python string functions.  
- spaCy enables **efficient NLP pipelines**, processing entire text documents with high accuracy.

## **Comparative Analysis: Scikit-learn vs TensorFlow**

| Aspect | Scikit-learn | TensorFlow |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Target Applications** | Classical ML (e.g., regression, clustering, decision trees) | Deep learning (e.g., CNNs, RNNs, Transformers) |
| **Ease of Use** | Simple API, ideal for beginners | More complex setup but scalable |
| **Community Support** | Strong in academia and education | Massive community for production-level AI |

💡 **Summary:**  
Scikit-learn is ideal for traditional machine learning workflows (smaller datasets and interpretable models),  
while TensorFlow is suited for large-scale deep learning and real-world deployment.
